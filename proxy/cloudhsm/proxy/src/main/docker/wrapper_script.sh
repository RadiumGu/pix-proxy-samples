# Changes vs. upstream (see VERIFICATION.md and upstream issue #17):
#   1. Configure EVERY ACTIVE HSM in the cluster, not just Hsms[0].
#   2. Bound the readiness wait with a timeout and fail fast instead of hanging forever.
#   3. exec the JVM so it becomes PID 1 and receives SIGTERM (graceful shutdown).

# 2. Discover and configure ALL active HSMs
#
#    Upstream used --query "Clusters[0].Hsms[0].EniIp", i.e. only the FIRST HSM.
#    That silently defeats multi-AZ high availability: every task pins itself to one
#    HSM, the others serve no traffic while still being billed, and an HSM
#    replacement (which changes the ENI IP) takes the fleet down until restarted.

# 3. Start the client daemon and wait for readiness, WITH A TIMEOUT
#
#    Upstream looped `while true` with no timeout: a wrong security group, a bad
#    customerCA.crt or an empty HSM IP left the container neither ready nor exited,
#    so ECS could not fail fast and retry.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Hand over to the JVM
#
#    `exec` makes the JVM PID 1 so that SIGTERM from ECS reaches it directly.
#    Without it the signal goes to this shell and graceful shutdown can be lost,
#    meaning in-flight payment requests are killed abruptly.

# DNS cache bound, and it MUST be here rather than in application code.
#
# Manual de Seguranca do Pix section 2 requires clients to respect the DNS TTL, and the
# JVM does not: it applies its own fixed cache, defaulting to 30s with no security
# manager and to -1 (CACHE FOREVER) when one is installed. A stale address then
# outlives a BCB endpoint move for the life of the process, which is the "loss of
# access" the manual warns about.
#
# MEASURED: the JDK reads networkaddress.cache.ttl ONCE, in the static initializer of
# sun.net.InetAddressCachePolicy. The proxy resolves names during startup (SSM, Secrets
# Manager, the Firehose client) before its Camel routes are configured, so a
# Security.setProperty call from application code runs after the policy has frozen and
# changes nothing - it sets the property and the JVM keeps using the old value.
# sun.net.inetaddr.ttl is the system-property fallback the JDK consults when the
# security property is unset, and -D is the only way to get a value in before the first
# lookup. DnsCachePolicy.apply() still runs and now VERIFIES the effective value,
# logging loudly if it disagrees, but this line is what actually does the work.
#
# --add-exports lets that verification read the effective policy; without it the log
# says "UNVERIFIED" rather than falsely confirming.
